# MacDirectory

This project need serious love. I first started it in 2013 and never touched it again. Main goal was to offer a end user GUI to the macOS directory service, so end user could be able to edit their own info and look for others in the system. This also present info from the contacts branch of the directory.

Directory integoration is working, a lot of work need to be done on the UI to present infos the best possible way and offer IT some manageable settings to restrict some content (like UID < 1024).
